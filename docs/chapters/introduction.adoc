== Introduction

WildFly 8 (nee JBoss Application Server 7) is a lightweight, flexible, Java EE 7 compliant, polyglot, and open source application server.

This self-paced hands-on lab introduces the basic administrative features of WildFly 8. A comprehensive lab that covers Java EE 7 development using WildFly is available at: https://github.com/javaee-samples/javaee7-hol.

NOTE: This document is a work in progress. The latest version of this document is available at http://github.com/arun-gupta/wildfly-lab. Please send pull requests to contribute or file issues.

=== Getting Started

Download the WildFly 8 `Application Server Distribution' zip file from http://wildfly.org/downloads/ and unzip.

Lets get familiar with the directory structure.

[cols="2,8", options="header"]
|===
| Directory | Purpose

| appclient
| Configuration files, deployment content, log files, and writeable areas used by the application client from this installation

| bin
| Startup scripts, startup configuration files and other command line utilities

| docs
| XML Schema definition files and sample configurations

| domain
| Configuration files, deployment content, log files, and writeable areas used by the managed domain from this installation

| domain/lib/ext
| Directory for installed library jars referenced by applications using the Extension-List mechanism for this domain

| domain/servers
| Writable area for each application server instance that runs in this domain. Each server has its own directory., created when the server is started.

| modules
| Various modules used in the server

| standalone
| Configuration files, deployment content, log files, and writeable areas used by the single standalone server from this installation

| standalone/deployments
| Directory for filesystem-based automatic deployment

| standalone/lib/ext
| Directory for installed library jars referenced by applications using the Extension-List mechanism for this instance

| welcome-content
| Default welcome page content

==== Standalone and Managed Domain

WildFly 8 can be started in two different modes:

. A _standalone_ server is an independent instance. It can be started using `bin/standalone.sh` launch script on Unix-variety of machines and `bin/standalone.bat` on Windows.
+
. A _managed domain_ that allows you to run and manage a multi-server topology and manage multiple WildFly instances from a single control point. It can be started using `bin/domain.sh` launch script on Unix-variety of machines and `bin/domain.bat` on Windows.
+
A Domain Controller is the central management control point for the collection of servers in the `domain'. More details about starting WildFly in managed domain mode, server topology and central management is explained in <<clustering>>.

==== Web Profile and Full Platform

Java EE defines _profiles_ that represent a configuration of the full platform suited to a particular class of applications. The Java EE Web Profile is defined as a separate specification in the platform, and is defined as a subset of technologies contained in the platform and targeted toward the developers of modern web applications.

WildFly supports both Web Profile and Full Platform by defining ``configuration profiles'' in different files. These profiles are defined in `standalone/configuration/*.xml` files for standalone instance and `domain/configuration/domain.xml` for managed domain.

. Start a WildFly instance in web profile
+
[source]
----
./bin/standalone.sh
----
+
This starts WildFly standalone instance server in web profile. By default it refers to `standalone\configuration\standalone.xml` configuration file which offers more capabilities than just web profile.
+
Access http://localhost:8080 and see the following page to make sure the server is running correctly.
+

+
Use Ctrl+C to stop the running server.
+
. Start WildFly in full platform by specifying the configuration as:
+
[source]
----
./bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml
----
+
The name of the configuration file, without `.xml` suffix, from `standalone/configuration' directory is specified as the parameter.
+
Use Ctrl+C to stop the running server.

==== Multiple instances on the same machine

Multiple instances of standalone server can be started on the same machine by specifying a port offset option to the `standalone.sh` or `standalone.bat` script.

. Start another instance of standalone server at port 9080 using the following command:
+
[source]
----
./bin/standalone.sh -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=1000
----
+
This will start another standalone instance server on port 9080 (=8080 + 1000) as the default application port and 10990 (=9990 + 1000) as the default management port. These port numbers would differ if non-default ports were used.
+
After the server is stated the welcome page is now accessible at http://localhost:9080.
+
Use Ctrl+C to stop the running server.
