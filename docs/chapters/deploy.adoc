== Deploying Applications to WildFly

*Purpose*: This section explains different ways to deploy Java EE 7 applications to WildFly.

Make sure to start a WildFly standalone instance for each sub-section unless stated otherwise. A standalone instance can be started as:

[source]
----
standalone.sh
----

=== File system

Deploying archives such as war, ear, and rar files using file system is as simple as copying to `standalone/deployments` directory. The deployment can be configured for auto-deploy or manual mode.

Any archive can be placed in `standalone/deployments` directory and is automatically deployed to the server. This is the default behavior.

CAUTION: This deployment mode is only intended to be used during development phase. Managed domain mode is recommended if running production systems.

. Clone the github repo by giving the following command:
+
[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/arun-gupta/wildfly-lab.git
----
+
. Change directory to `samples/javaee7` and build the sample as:
+
[source]
----
mvn install
----
+
. Copy the war file to `standalone/deployments` directory using the following command:
+
[source]
----
cp target/javaee7-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war /Users/arungupta/workspaces/wildfly/build/target/wildfly-8.0.0.Final-SNAPSHOT/standalone/deployments
----
+
Make sure to change the directory name to match your filesystem.
+
. Verify the deployed application by accessing the webpage http://localhost:8080/javaee7-1.0-SNAPSHOT/EmployeeList and see the output as:
+
image::images/deploy-javaee7-sample-output.png[title="Java EE 7 sample application output"]

=== Administration Console

The Admin Console is a web-based administration console and available at http://localhost:9990/console.

. A new user in the management realm needs to be added before the admin console can be accessed.
+
A new user can be added in the management realm using `add-user.sh` script. This can be done non-interactively by giving the following command:
+
[source]
----
add-user.sh -u sheldon -p bazinga
----
+
The output of the command looks like:
+
[source]
----
Added user 'sheldon' to file '/Users/arungupta/workspaces/wildfly/build/target/wildfly-8.0.0.Final-SNAPSHOT/standalone/configuration/mgmt-users.properties'
Added user 'sheldon' to file '/Users/arungupta/workspaces/wildfly/build/target/wildfly-8.0.0.Final-SNAPSHOT/domain/configuration/mgmt-users.properties'
----
+
The directory names `standalone' and `domain' indicate that the user is added to both standalone instance and managed domain. The file name indicates that it is added to the management realm.
+
TIP: A user can be added to application realm by including `-a` switch.
+
Alternatively, the user can be added interactively by invoking the script and entering the values on the prompt as shown:
+
[source]
----
add-user.sh

What type of user do you wish to add? 
 a) Management User (mgmt-users.properties) 
 b) Application User (application-users.properties)
(a): <take default>

Enter the details of the new user to add.
Using realm 'ManagementRealm' as discovered from the existing property files.
Username : <sheldon>
Password requirements are listed below. To modify these restrictions edit the add-user.properties configuration file.
 - The password must not be one of the following restricted values {root, admin, administrator}
 - The password must contain at least 8 characters, 1 alphanumeric character(s), 1 digit(s), 1 non-alphanumeric symbol(s)
 - The password must be different from the username
Password : <bazinga>
JBAS015269: Password must have at least 8 characters!
Are you sure you want to use the password entered yes/no? <yes>
Re-enter Password : <bazinga>
What groups do you want this user to belong to? (Please enter a comma separated list, or leave blank for none)[  ]: 
About to add user 'sheldon' for realm 'ManagementRealm'
Is this correct yes/no? <yes>
Added user 'sheldon' to file '/Users/arungupta/workspaces/wildfly/build/target/wildfly-8.0.0.Final-SNAPSHOT/standalone/configuration/mgmt-users.properties'
Added user 'sheldon' to file '/Users/arungupta/workspaces/wildfly/build/target/wildfly-8.0.0.Final-SNAPSHOT/domain/configuration/mgmt-users.properties'
Added user 'sheldon' with groups  to file '/Users/arungupta/workspaces/wildfly/build/target/wildfly-8.0.0.Final-SNAPSHOT/standalone/configuration/mgmt-groups.properties'
Added user 'sheldon' with groups  to file '/Users/arungupta/workspaces/wildfly/build/target/wildfly-8.0.0.Final-SNAPSHOT/domain/configuration/mgmt-groups.properties'
Is this new user going to be used for one AS process to connect to another AS process? 
e.g. for a slave host controller connecting to the master or for a Remoting connection for server to server EJB calls.
yes/no? <no>
----
+
Now accessing the console at http://localhost:9990/console prompts for a username and password. Enter the username `sheldon' and password `bazinga' and then the console is shown as:
+
image::images/deploy-admin-console.png[title="Admin console"]
+
The added user can be disabled by giving the following command:
+
[source]
----
add-user.sh -u sheldon -d
----
+
TIP: User can be deleted by deleting the corresponding line from `domain/configuration/mgmt-users.properties` and `standalone/configuration/mgmt-users.properties` files.
+
. Click on `Manage Deployments' to see the output as:
+
image::images/deploy-admin-console-deployments-first.png[title="Admin console deployments"]
+
. Click on `Add' button to see:
+
image::images/deploy-admin-console-add-first.png[title="Add a deployment"]
+
. Click on `Choose File' button and select the war file.
+
Click on `Next >>' button. Take the defaults and click `Save'.
+
. By default the application is not enabled and the console shows:
+
image::images/deploy-enable-disable-app.png[title="En/Disable button"]
+
Click on `En/Disable' button, click on `Confirm' and now the app is ready to be used. Access the application http://localhost:8080/javaee7-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war/EmployeeList.

=== Command Line Interface (jboss-cli)

`jboss-cli.sh` or `jboss-cli.bat` is Command Line Interface management tool for a standalone server or a managed domain. It allows a user to connect to a standalone server or domain controller and execute management operations.

More details about using jboss-cli for managing the server are available in <<jboss-cli>>.

`jboss-cli' can be used to deploy applications using the interactive console or in a non-interactive manner.

==== Interactive

. Use jboss-cli to connect with the existing standalone instance by giving the following command:
+
[source]
----
jboss-cli.sh -c
----
+
The `-c` switch connects using the default host (`localhost') and management port (`9990'). These values are specified in `jboss-cli.xml' and can be updated.
+
This opens up the `jboss-cli' interactive console and shows the following prompt:
+
[source]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /]
----
+
The prompt indicates that `jboss-cli' is connected to a standalone instance's management port.
+
. Deploy the application by giving the following command in console:
+
[source]
----
deploy target/javaee7-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war
----
+
The directory name of the war file in the command may be different depending upon how `jboss-cli' was invoked. Verify the server log to ensure that the application was redeployed. Look for specific timestamp in the log entries.
+
TIP: `--force` switch can be included in the command to replace the existing application.
+
. Verify the deployment status by typing the following command `deployment-info` in the console:
+
[source]
----
deployment-info
----
+
and see the output as:
+
[source]
----
NAME                     RUNTIME-NAME             PERSISTENT ENABLED STATUS 
javaee7-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war javaee7-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war true       true    OK   
----
+
Verify the server log to ensure that the application was deployed. Look for specific timestamp in the log entries.
+
. Undeploy the application by giving the following command:
+
[source]
----
undeploy javaee7-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war
----
+
. Type `exit` `quit' to exit `jboss-cli' interactive console.

==== Non-interactive

Non-interactive mode allows to support scripts and other types of command line or batch processing.

. Deploy the application using the following command:
+
[source]
----
jboss-cli.sh --connect --command="deploy target/javaee7-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war --force"
----
+
The directory name of the war file in the command may be different depending upon how `jboss-cli' was invoked. Verify the server log to ensure that the application was redeployed. Look for specific timestamp in the log entries.
+
Verify the deployed application at http://localhost:8080/javaee7/EmployeeList and look for a similar output.
+
. Verify the deployment status by giving the following command:
+
[source]
----
jboss-cli.sh --connect --command=deployment-info
----
+
. Undeploy the application by giving the following command:
+
[source]
----
jboss-cli.sh --connect --command="undeploy javaee7-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war"
----

=== Curl

curl is a free and popular command line tool for transfering data using URL syntax. If you don't have it installed on your machine then it can be downloaded from http://curl.haxx.se/download.html.

Deploying applications using curl is a two-step process.

. Upload your archive to WildFly using the following command
+
[source]
----
curl -F "file=@target/javaee7-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war" --digest http://sheldon:bazinga@localhost:9990/management/add-content
----
+
This command:
+
.. Makes a POST request using form-encoded (`-F`) data with one field (`file`) defining location of the WAR file
.. `target/javaee7-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war` is location of the WAR file
.. `sheldon` is a user with administrative privileges and password `bazinga`
.. `localhost:9090` is the default management host and port for WildFly instance
.. WildFly management port uses digest authentication and that is defined using `–digest`
.. Prints the output as something like:
+
[source]
----
{“outcome” : “success”, “result” : { “BYTES_VALUE” : “+Dg9u1ALXacrndNdLrT3DQSaqjw=” }}
----
+
. Deploy the uploaded archive using the following command:
+
[source]
----
curl -S -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"content":[{"hash": {"BYTES_VALUE" : "+Dg9u1ALXacrndNdLrT3DQSaqjw="}}], "address": [{"deployment":"javaee7-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war"}], "operation":"add", "enabled":"true"}' --digest http://sheldon:bazinga@localhost:9990/management
----
+
This command:
+
.. Sends a POST request (`-d`) with JSON payload
.. Value assigned to `result` name in the JSON response of previous command is assigned to `hash` name in this command
.. Content type of the payload is explicitly specified to be `application/json` using `-H`
.. `add` command triggers the deployment of the archive
.. Application archive is enabled as well, as opposed to not by default
.. As in previous command, `sheldon` is the administrative user with password `bazinga`
.. As in previous command, `localhost:9090` is the default management host and port for WildFly instance
.. As in previous command, WildFly management port uses digest authentication and that is defined using `–digest`

=== Maven plugin

The wildfly-maven-plugin is used to deploy, redeploy, undeploy or run your application. You can also deploy or undeploy artifacts, such as JDBC drivers, and add or remove resources. There is also the ability to execute CLI commands.

. Note that `samples/javaee7/pom.xml` contains the following fragment:
+
[source, xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.wildfly.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>wildfly-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0.Beta1</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <phase>install</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>deploy</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
----
+
This specifies the `wildfly-maven-plugin' description to `pom.xml'. It also invokes the plugin `deploy' target during the standard maven `install' phase.
+
. Start a WildFly instance as:
+
[source]
----
standalone.sh
----
+
. Deploy the application by giving the command:
+
[source]
----
mvn wildfly:deploy
----
+
or
+
[source]
----
mvn install
----
+
. Access the web page at http://localhost:8080/javaee7/EmployeeList and see the output as:
+

=== Java

A standalone WildFly process or a managed domain can be configured to listen for remote management requests using its ``native management interface''. This interface uses an open protocol based on the JBoss Remoting library. JBoss Remoting is used to establish a communication channel from the client to the process being managed. Once the communication channel is established the primary traffic over the channel is management requests initiated by the client and asynchronous responses from the target process.

Deployment using a custom Java class is a two-step process:

. First step is to build a deployment plan that describe the steps of uploading the archive to the content repository and deploying it.
. Second step involves executing the deployment plan on the application server instance.

Lets create an application that will allow us to deploy a Java EE 7 application using a Java-based class.

. Create a maven project as:
+
[source]
----
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.maven.archetypes -DgroupId=org.wildfly.samples -DartifactId=deployment -DinteractiveMode=false
----
+
. Open the created Maven project in NetBeans, Eclipse, IntelliJ or any other editor of your choice. The custom client must have maven artifact `org.jboss.as:jboss-as-controller-client' and its dependencies on the classpath. `org.jboss:jboss-dmr' is maven artifact for detyped representation of the management model and must be added to the list of maven dependencies as well.
+
This can be achieved by adding the following dependencies in `pom.xml`:
+
[source]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jboss.as</groupId>
    <artifactId>jboss-as-controller-client</artifactId>
    <version>7.2.0.Final</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jboss</groupId>
    <artifactId>jboss-dmr</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.0.Final</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----
+
Note that both the dependencies are added in `test' scope.
+
. Edit the `src/test/java/org/wildfly/samples/AppTest.java` file and add a method as shown:
+
[source]
----
ModelControllerClient createClient(final InetAddress host, final int port,
            final String username, final String password) {

   final CallbackHandler callbackHandler = new CallbackHandler() {

       @Override
       public void handle(Callback[] callbacks) throws IOException, UnsupportedCallbackException {
           for (Callback current : callbacks) {
               if (current instanceof NameCallback) {
                   NameCallback ncb = (NameCallback) current;
                   ncb.setName(username);
               } else if (current instanceof PasswordCallback) {
                   PasswordCallback pcb = (PasswordCallback) current;
                   pcb.setPassword(password.toCharArray());
               } else {
                   throw new UnsupportedCallbackException(current);
               }
           }
       }
    };

    return ModelControllerClient.Factory.create(host, port, callbackHandler);
}
----
+
In this code:
+
.. `ModelControllerClient` is used to manage a WildFly server instance or a Domain Controller or slave Host Controller.
.. A new instance is created by specifying host, port, and a Callback handler to obtain authentication information for the call. Typically these credentials are obtained from a dialog box, such as a GUI-base client. In our case the credentials will be passed when this method is invoked.
+
. Update `testApp` method such that it looks like:
+
[source]
----
public void testApp() throws IOException, InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
    // create client
    ModelControllerClient client = createClient(InetAddress.getByName("localhost"),
        9999,
        "sheldon",
        "bazinga");

    // connect
    ServerDeploymentManager manager = ServerDeploymentManager.Factory.create(client);

    // build a deployment plan
    DeploymentPlan plan = manager
        .newDeploymentPlan()
        .add(new File("/Users/arungupta/workspaces/wildfly-lab/samples/javaee7/target/javaee7-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war"))
        .andDeploy()
        .build();

    // run it
    ServerDeploymentPlanResult result = manager.execute(plan).get();
}
----
+
Make sure to resolve imports from `org.jboss.as.controller.client.helpers.standalone.*` package. Also change the directory name to match your filesystem.
+
In this code:
+
.. A new instance of client for controlling application server management model is created by specifying the correct host, port, username, and password. Note that the username and password are the ones specified earlier.
.. `ServerDeploymentManager` is the primary deployment interface for a standalone instance. A new instance is created by using the previously created `ModelControllerClient`.
.. `newDeploymentPlan` initiates the creation of a new `DeploymentPlan`. Archive is added to the repository using `add` method and deployed using `andDeploy` method. Finally the deployment plan is built using `build` method. Note the location of archive may be different in your environment.
.. Finally the deployment plan is executed using `execute` method.
+
. Perform the deployment by running the test as:
+
[source]
----
mvn test
----
+
. Check the server log to ensure that the application is deployed. The following server log entries should be visible:
+
[source]
----
14:08:57,052 INFO  [org.wildfly.extension.undertow] (MSC service thread 1-9) JBAS017534: Register web context: /javaee7-1.0-SNAPSHOT
14:08:57,063 INFO  [org.jboss.as.server] (management-handler-thread - 17) JBAS018559: Deployed "javaee7-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war" (runtime-name : "javaee7-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war")
----
+
You may see the error message as:
+
[source]
----
JBAS014616: Operation ("add") failed - address: ([("deployment" => "javaee7-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war")]) - failure description: "JBAS014803: Duplicate resource [(\"deployment\" => \"javaee7-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war\")]"
----
+
This occurs if the archive has been previously deployed.

TIP: `addDeploy` method may be replaced with `andReplace("javaee7-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war")` to replace a previously deployed archive.
